<p>Sports have always been a big part of my life—they keep me active, focused, and disciplined. Whether it’s playing badminton or catching up on the latest games, I enjoy the<br>
  energy and spirit that sports bring. Alongside this, I have a deep interest in technology. I love diving into the world of web development and exploring how tech can solve <br>
